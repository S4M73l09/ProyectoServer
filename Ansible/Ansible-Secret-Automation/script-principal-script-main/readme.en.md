# What does this script?
----------------------------------------------------------------

This is the main script in charge of joining the .yml so that everything works as a solid block, it takes the variables from SP-ROTATOR.env and uses them to certify itself as the service in charge of rotating. Once it has what it needs, run the first.yml file called rotation-secret and then run the .yml purge-deletion to clean up the history and old secrets that are unused.

As always, the data in this script is censored for greater security, eliminating or changing the name, subscription, tenant and so on.
